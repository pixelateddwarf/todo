# To Do List - Tests Branch

This is a very simple to do list application written in rails 4.
I am using this to test CRUD and rails testing (TDD).

* Feel free to use this code "as is" without any warrenties or support.
  This code is open source

## Gems used in the project for testing

1. **[rspec-rails](https://github.com/rspec/rspec-rails)** - A complete BDD testing library.
1. **[capybara](https://github.com/jnicklas/capybara)** - mimics how a real user would interact with your app.
1. **[shoulda-matchers](https://github.com/thoughtbot/shoulda-matchers)** - RSpec-compatible one-liners for tests.
