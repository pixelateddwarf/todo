++ To Do List

This is a very simple to do list application written in rails 4.
I am using this to test CRUD and rails testing in development.

Feel free to use this code "as is" without any warrenties or support.

++ Gems used in the project for testing

1. rspec-rails
1. shoulda-matchers
1. capybara
